# BohrModelGenerator
## Background
I had a science minor in which I needed to draw a Bohr model for the first 20 elements on the Periodic Table.
Me being me (disliking drawing, liking to overcomplicate everything), I decided to make a program that would generate the Bohr models for me.

## Running it yourself
### Python Dependencies:
- Pillow (Python Imaging Library)
### Running:
- `python3 main.py`
